Task Cluster Packer Boxes
======

Central repo for all virtual machine images needed by the task
cluster project. [packer](http://packer.io/) is used to build the
images along with some fairly simple bash scripts (on linux anyway).

## Requirements

  - [packer](http://packer.io/) 
  - make

## Layout

The [boxes](/boxes) folder contains the _output_ of the actual boxes
generated by the other folders. For example the (dev_base)[/dev_base]
box contains a low level ubuntu vm image for the vagrant image.

The [Makefile](/Makefile) is used to generate the boxes (and potential
variables / dependencies needed by those boxes).

## Testing

The goal is ultimately to leverage docker images as much as possible for
task cluster so if possible complex logic should live in docker images
instead of the virtual machines. If you need to test some kind of
complex logic do it in bash (or whatever your using on the vm)

```sh
#!/bin/bash -vex

# (v)erbose and (e)xit on failure are most important things here but (x)
# also shows the actual value on each line (with variables expanded)

do_stuff_to_get_nodejs

# this will fail horribly if node is not present
node -v
````

## Deployment to S3

XXX TODO
